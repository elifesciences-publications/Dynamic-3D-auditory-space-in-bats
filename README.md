#  How to use code
#
------------
Download and directory setup
------------
Download the code (.m files) and data (.mat files) from https://github.com/ninadbkothari/Dynamic-3D-auditory-space-in-bats
Place in desired folder.
Place all code and data in same folder (for ease of use - but not necessary)

------------
Code requirements
------------
The code was tested on Matlab(R) 2014b version but should be compatible on previous versions also (not tested).
The code does not require any special Matlab Toolbox.
